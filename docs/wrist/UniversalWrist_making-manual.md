In this manual you will find information to help you understand in details how is made the ORTHOPUS Universal Wrist so you can make it yourself (modern machine shop workstations required), directly with a manufacturer or simply repair/upgrade it yourself.

### **List of parts**

On the following picture, you can find an exploded view showing all the parts of the Universal Wrist. In the table, links allow you to find where components can be purchased or, for the machined or injected ones, where we are manufacturing them.

### **Manufacturing**

Manufacturing the Universal Wrist requires advanced knowledge and machinery such as lathe, milling and drilling machines, etc... However, if you have all the required machinery, with the .STEP files [available here](https://github.com/orthopus/01-wrist/blob/main/src/Wrist/WRIST-210122.step) and the drawings [available here](https://github.com/orthopus/01-wrist/blob/main/src/Wrist/DRW-0109-1xxx-Wrist_Drawing_B.pdf) of the Universal Wrist, you should be able to make your own.

ORTHOPUS has chosen [Menetou MÃ©canique](https://www.menetoumecanique.com/) to manufacture in France 100% of its Universal Wrist.
