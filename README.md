**üöß WORK IN PROGRESS üöß** 

*We are currently working on updating this repository.*

This repository contents documentation of : 

- **The Universal Wrist** : a mechanical wrist and his mechanical tool-holder. The wrist fits into a socket for quick connection-disconnection of different terminal devices such as the [ORTHOPUS Work Hook or the Aesthetic Hand](https://orthopus.com/en/upper-limb-prosthetics/).
- **Tool holders** : compatible with the ORTHOPUS Universal Wrist. For now you can already find a 3D printer version.
